                                    pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.95 and actively participate
                                    in local musicals, fun runs, and skydiving! I earned my associate of arts degree in music from Grays
                                    Harbor Community College in 2017 and briefly attended Pacific Lutheran University to study music
                                    composition before transferring to Washington State University in 2019.

                                    help as a TA for an introduction to Python course. As a teacher's assistant I grade student assignments
                                    and host weekly labs which cover basic principles such as lists, dictionaries, graphical user interfaces,
                                    file systems, and more. I created this site using HTML and Flask and use apache2 with a dynamic network
                                    service to maintain a static url. I update my website regularly, adding new projects such as music and
                                    programs. Check back periodically to see any new content I have added!

                                    which grants me permission to jump with a camera, wingsuit, and perform small demonstration jumps.
                                    My goal now is to continue advancing my freeflying skills and eventually become an instructor in the
                                    sport. For now, I am jumping for fun at my home dropzone in Shelton, WA and traveling to other dropzones
                                    around the state whenever I can!
