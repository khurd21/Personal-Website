	My name is Kyle Hurd and I am currently attending Washington State University to
	pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.95
	and actively participate in local musicals, fun runs, and skydiving! I earned
	my associate of arts degree in music from Grays Harbor Community College in 2017
	and briefly attended Pacific Lutheran University to study music composition
	before transferring to Washington State University in 2019.

	Programming! At Washington State University I have studied C/C++ and also currently
	help as a TA for an introduction to Python course. As a teacher's assistant I grade
	student assignments and host weekly labs which cover basic principles such as lists,
	dictionaries, graphical user interfaces, file systems, and more. I created this site
	using HTML and Flask and use apache2 with a dynamic network service to maintain a
	static url. I update my website regularly, adding new projects such as music and programs.
	Check back periodically to see any new content I have added!

	Skydiving! I am an avid skydiver with 375 jumps to my name and a type 'C' License
	which grants me permission to jump with a camera, wingsuit, and perform small
	demonstration jumps. My goal now is to continue advancing my freeflying skills
	and eventually become an instructor in the sport. For now, I am jumping for fun
	at my home dropzone in Shelton, WA and traveling to other dropzones around the state
	whenever I can!
